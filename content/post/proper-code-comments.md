Code comments are just as they sound. They are extra documentation about the software you are writting that isn't actually executed. They should allow you to make your code clearer.

Often Novice developers will over-user, under-use and worst of all misuse comments. Let's go over an example

    // a: minimum number
    // b: maximum number
    // returns a random number within given //range
    static int rnd(int a, int b){
        ...code ...
    }

Con's to comments

1.  Must be updated when the code is (it often isn't)
2.  Language barriers can make comments detrimental more than helpful
3.  Clutters up being able to actually read the code

    static int randomNumberInclusive(int minimumRang int maximumRange){
    ... code ...
    }

         //SindyScript
         @fn sum a,b
             a+b
         ;

         // JavaScript
         function sum (a,b){
             return a+b;
         }

         // C# / Java
         public static void Sum (int a, int b){
             return a+b;
         }

         // Go
         func sum(a int, b int) int {
        	        return a + b
         }

         // Ruby
         def sum(a,b)
             a+b
         end

         // Lua
         function sum(a,b)
             return a+b
         end

         // Rust
         fn sum(a: u32, b: u32) -> u32 {
             return false;
         }
