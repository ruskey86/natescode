Do you want to become a software developer? I titled this post with _computer programmer_ because for those that really don't know anything about software they may write programmer more than developer. 

Here I'll make _you_ a "new"

    Programmer You = new Programmer();

1. Picking a programming language

   This can be daunting but in reality there shouldn't be a whole lot of thought put into it. To paraphrase a 20 year software veteran  "The first language you learn teaches you to think in code. The second language you learn teaches you to separate the programming concepts."

   SO I'll pick it for you:

    JavaScript

The concepts 

1. Variables
2. Functions
3. Objects
4. Inheritance
   1. Prototype based
5. Lambdas
