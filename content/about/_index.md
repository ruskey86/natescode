_The Hunchback of Notre-Dame_ (French: _Notre-Dame de Paris_) I'm a software developer, (full-stack, cross-platform mobile, devops, cms if you're interested) based in the midwest. I love teaching others how to write code, more importantly, engineer and architect software solutions effectively and quickly.
