Well I was born and all that. Fast forward to high school. I learned to program my TI-84 Plus graphing calculator to do all my math homework for me. I even got it to draw a triangle and label all of the angles and sides for me. My friends and I later went on to create simple mostly-text based RPG games. I also learned some C++ but there weren't too many resources online in the early 2000's.

I did a 2 year degree program to learn programming. The professors were mostly stuck thinking web development was still in the early 90's. Needless to say I still had a LOT left to learn. I spent my summers staying up until 2am reading blogs from professional developers that were much smarter and more experienced that I was. I learned a ton, most of the time falling into the next level of inception as I learned one thing that lead me to another. I spent a lot of time building small projects to learn the fundamentals. 

I spent time consulting on Phonegap/Cordova based mobile projects and making a fairly popular Phonegap tutorial series on YouTube.

Fast-forward 5 years and life has changed quite a lot. I have a well established career now. I mostly telecommute (yeah no drive to work!) and spend time doing contract work on the side. 

Now, 2018, I want to start building NatesCode as well as the corresponding YouTube channel to help others learn to code.


THE END
